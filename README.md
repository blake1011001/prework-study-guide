# Prework Study Guide Webpage 

## Description

- My motivation for building this webpage was to have an easily accessible and orginized place for my bootcamp notes.
- I built this project to help me be successful in my bootcamp course.
- The problem I solved was not having an interactive place to store my notes.
- I learned how to navigate and create in HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript along with working with the chrome toolbar.
